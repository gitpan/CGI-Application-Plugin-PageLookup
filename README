CGI-Application-Plugin-PageLookup

A model component for CGI::Application built around a table that has one row for each
page and that provides aupport for multiple languages and the 'dot' notation in templates.
The core is the cgiapp_pages table which contains one row for every page.
There are side tables for language independent data (cgiapp_structure) and for
data that should be consistent across a language (cgiapp_lang).
There is also facility for using "dot notation" objects as described in HTML::Template::Plugin::Dot.
This module also makes it easy to manage your XML sitemaps, meta data, not found pages and expiry headers
	
In particular this module provides:

	Value	- manage pieces of text that are scattered across a website
	Loop	- manage repitive list style structures in a website
	Href	- manage your URLs so that they are always search engine friendly, independent
		of internal representation and always in the language of that page.
	Menu	- manage your menus and human readable sitemaps
